We are very excited to announce that we have added 21 new themes ported from [[https://bootswatch.com/][Bootswatch]] version 4.
In these 21 themes, [[https://semantic-ui-forest/themes/bootswatch-v4/litera/][Litera]], [[https://semantic-ui-forest/themes/bootswatch-v4/lux/][Lux]], [[https://semantic-ui-forest/themes/bootswatch-v4/materia/][Materia]], [[https://semantic-ui-forest/themes/bootswatch-v4/pulse/][Pulse]], [[https://semantic-ui-forest/themes/bootswatch-v4/sketchy/][Sketchy]] are completely new.

It's quite easy to apply these themes to your sites. You could just click the ~Download~ button, and replace the original ~semantic.min.css~ with the theme.

All themes are open-sourced on GitHub:

- [[https://github.com/semantic-ui-forest/forest-themes][semantic-ui-forest/forest-themes]]: a collection of themes for Semantic UI.

If you have any problems, feel free to open an issue. And of course, pull requests are always welcomed.

One more thing, we have packed Semantic-UI-Forest themes into the 'forest-theme-css' NPM package, so it's more convenient to use it in your projects through the NPM package system.

You can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/forest-themes-css, not very popular at present, but growing steadily.

We are astonished to discover that there are already some packages, repositories, projects that use our work directly with different names, they are not officially and persistently maintained.
We are Semantic-UI-Forest, this is the only genuine one.

Still, we must give many thanks and show our respect to
[[https://semantic-ui.com/][Semantic-UI]] for this wonderful front-end framework, to [[https://nanoc.ws/][Nanoc]] for building static
websites easily and quickly, to [[https://bootswatch.com/][Bootswatch]] and [[https://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]] that inspired us a lot,
and to Github for hosting all of our work for free.

Happy building!
